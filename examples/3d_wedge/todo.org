* Todo

** Thoughts

   I'm not sure if I actually need the "origins" stuff or not

   Can I use the t_in and t_out fields instead?

** Things to do

   the order:
   1. [X] fix bad updates near diff edge
      + decided to skip utetra incident on diff utri
   2. [X] moving forward:
      - [X] jet32t -> jet31t
      - [X] dump "DP plan"
      - [X] propagate Hessian in Python (faster prototyping)
      - a bust!
   3. [X] fix propagating origins
      - [X] direct
      - [X] refl
   4. [X] compute D2T using cell averaging
      - [X] proof of concept (*seems to work better than anything else I've tried so far...*)
      - [X] move code into C
      - [X] fix corner cases
        - [X] point sources
        - [X] diffraction
   5. [X] compute ground truth amplitude
      1. [X] geometric factor
      2. [X] + UTD
   6. [X] add postprocessing pass to compute geometric amplitude
      - [X] try doing it in terms of amplitude
      - [X] try doing it in terms of intensity (*probably better*)
   7. [-] slice plots
      - [X] initial implementation in python
      - [X] bmesh33 for T error
      - [-] u
        - [X] compute amplitude field
        - [X] fix amplitude computation
          - [X] *i'm initializing D2T to 0 near the point source!!!*
          - [X] *make sure to actually compute the principal curvatures!!!*
        - [ ] add UTD (need t_in, t_out)
        - [ ] patching fields using origins
   8. [ ] building
      - [ ] set up and run direct
   9. [X] make error plots
      | field  | T | DT | D2T |
      |--------+---+----+-----|
      | direct | X | X  | X   |
      | o-refl | X | X  | X   |
      | n-refl | X | X  | X   |
   10. [ ] measure time and output it
   11. [ ] finish writing
   12. [ ] simplify paper to c = 1 w/o extra c varying stuff
   13. [ ] make nice 3D figures using inkscape
   14. [ ] send to ramani & masha
   15. [ ] make timing plots
   16. [ ] fix O(N^2) runtime (data structure problem)

   idea:
   - [ ] instead of local factoring... solve the eikonal equation
     once, determine the origins, then use the origins to provide a
     good initial guess past the diffracting edge... re-solve the
     eikonal equation?

   things to look in to:
   - [ ] print number of edge updates and vertex updates that i'm accepting
   - [ ] look at some of these and make sure i'm only accepting good ones
   - [ ] how am I actually initializing near the diffracting edge?

   final bug fixes:
   - [ ] bd tris:
     - [ ] only do them if (l0, lhat) is a boundary edge
     - [ ] check whether the update ray is physical
   - [ ] fix discontinuity in u_d...
   - [ ] don't use upwind nodes when approximating D2T...
   - [ ] when computing D2T, use exact value near point source
   - [ ] issue with element...
     + i'm using the C0 9-parameter element... error estimate?
     + the reduced C-T element is O(h^{3-p}) accurate... use that instead...!
       could explain reduced order of convergence

*** misc
   - [X] propagate origins
     - [X] direct
     - [X] reflection
   - [ ] after propagating, fix diffracting edge origin (set to 0.5)

   - [X] extract reflection zone boundary
   - [X] fix true o-refl solution
   - [ ] try problem with only n-refl
   - [ ] try problem with o- and n-refls

*** amplitude
    - [ ] numerical
      - [ ] direct
      - [ ] reflected
    - [ ] true
      - [ ] direct
      - [ ] o-refl
      - [ ] n-refl

*** u
    - [ ] numerical
    - [ ] true

*** errors
   - [X] get T errors to O(h) in direct & o-refl
   - [X] get DT errors to O(h) in direct & o-refl
   - [ ] get D2T errors to O(h)

** Plots to make
   - [ ] slice plots
     + restrict BBmesh to xy plane
     + pull out data
     + use this guy to make the plot: [[https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/tricontour_smooth_user.html#sphx-glr-gallery-images-contours-and-fields-tricontour-smooth-user-py][link]]
     + plot these (value & errors):
       - [ ] direct T
       - [ ] direct DT
       - [ ] direct D2T
       - [ ] direct amplitude
       - [ ] direct field
       - [ ] o-refl T
       - [ ] o-refl DT
       - [ ] o-refl D2T
       - [ ] o-refl amplitude
       - [ ] o-refl field
       - [ ] n-refl T
       - [ ] n-refl DT
       - [ ] n-refl D2T

       - [ ] n-refl field
       for a couple different parameters
     + [ ] plot combined field
